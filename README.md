## Why contribute to free/open source?
When you contribute to Open Source, you are taking part in the collaborative effort of a vast community of passionate developers and contributors! Free Source software allows you to see, use, and more importantly modify its source code. Contributing to Free Source is a great way to develop a deeper understanding of software, and the best part is being able to learn and teach alongside a community of contributors.

<br/>


<br/>

## How to contribute
Follow this step-by-step guide to make your first open source contribution. The steps you will perform in this guide is a somewhat standard workflow that you will encounter in most projects: Fork -> Clone -> Install dependencies -> Make your changes -> Run tests -> Commit -> PR

<br/>

# This project is to help you make a pull request (PR) in 10 easy steps

## Instructions-

If you don't have git on your machine, [install it](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### Optional Step

Configure Git Bash
```
 git config --global user.email "<your email>"
 git config --global user.user "<github username>"
```
Use your email and username as given on your github account

### Step 1

Fork <a href="https://github.com/Viz38/First-Pull-Request" target="_blank">THIS</a> repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.
![fork](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Viz38/First-Pull-Request/master/Assets/Fork.bmp)

### Step 2

Now clone the forked repo to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repo, click on the clone button and then click the *copy to clipboard* icon.
![clone](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Viz38/First-Pull-Request/master/Assets/Clone.bmp)

### Step 3

Open a terminal/git bash and run the following git command:

```
git clone "<paste the link here>"
```

### Step 4

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd First-Pull-Request
```
Now create a branch using the `git branch` command and change to new branch using `git checkout` command:
(Replace 'branch-name' with any name of your choice)
```
git branch <branch-name> 
git checkout <branch-name>
```

For example:
```
git branch newbranch
git checkout newbranch
```

### Step 5

Now open `Members.md` file in a text editor, Add yourself as given.

```
vi Members.md
```
Save and exit by pressing [ESC] key and type in `:wq`

### Step 6

Add the changes you've made to git by hitting the following command
```
git add Members.md
```

### Step 7
Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:
```
git commit -m "give your commit message here"
```

### Step 8

Push your changes using the command `git push`:
```
git push origin <add-your-branch-name>
```
replacing `<add-your-branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

### Step 9

If you go to <a href="https://github.com/Viz38/First-Pull-Request" target="_blank">THIS</a> repository on GitHub, you'll see a  `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.

### Resolve Merge Conflicts ###

Once changes have been committed and staged it's time to manage conflicts by running:

git pull upstream master
Head back to your favourite code editor and review any conflicts. Generally current changes will be highlighted in one color and incoming changes will be highlighted in a different color. Accept the current or incoming changes.

Commit changes again as outlined in step #9 and #10 above or by running:

```
git add -A
```
```
git commit -m "Your message"
```
```
git push origin <your-new-branch-name>
```
